# Getting Started with TODO List Application
This application is being built using React, Java and SQL. It's a simple application that helps with keeping track of task to be completed.
Once the user has entered a task to be completed, it will stay there until it is finished and removed by user.

## Still working on:
* **TODO list page --> let user input task, remove task instead of hard code examples**
* **Create database and connect it to the app to let users log in and scan previously created accounts**
* **Create API handling using Java, Springboot**
* **Deploy app using AWS or Kubernetes**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
