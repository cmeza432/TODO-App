# TODO-App
Full Stack TODO app created using React, Java and SQL

# Getting Started with TODO List Application
This application is being built using React, Java and SQL. It's a simple application that helps user keep track of task needed to be completed.
Once the user has entered a task, it will be present until it is deleted or updated by user.

## Still working on:
* **TODO list page --> let user input task, remove task instead of hard code examples**
* **Create database and connect it to the app to let users log in and scan previously created accounts**
* **Create API handling using Java, Springboot**
* **Figure out features, like showing history of completed task or delete once updated. Is this going to be adjustable to daily, weekly or just daily.**
* **Deploy app using AWS or Kubernetes**
